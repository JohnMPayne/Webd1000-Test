            Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man <br>
            Bake me a cake as fast as you can <br>
            Pat it and roll it and mark it with a B <br>
            <strong>And put it in the oven for baby and me</strong><br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man <br>

            Pat it and roll it and mark it with a B <br>
            <strong>And put it in the oven for baby and me</strong><br>
