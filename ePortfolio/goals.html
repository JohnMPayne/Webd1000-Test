        <h1>Johns Goals Page</h1>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p id="para1">
            <h3>Work in IT Industry</h3>
            So far I have yet to work in a related field that I have studied in. From this within the next two years <br>
            I want to work in the IT industry and gain relative experience. <br>  
        <p id="para2">
            <h3>Work in  Role I Enjoy</h3>
            Having a job I enjoy going to everyday is something that is  very important to me. Since so much of our lives <br>
            are spent working, I want to work a job that I enjoy, and get pleasure out of. <br>
        <p id="para3">
            <h3>Build a Solid Network of Collegues</h3>
            After completing my first year as an IT student, I understand that creating connections within the industry is <br>
            extremely important. By increasing and building a solid network of collegues, it will increase my knowledge and <br>
            help my success. <br>
        <p id="para4">
            <h3>Develop Skills</h3>
            Within the next two years of my school and professional journey, I want to develop my IT skills. I want to <br>
            be a lifelong learner, as keeping up to date with new and improved technology is very important in the IT <br>
            field. <br>
        <p id="para5">
            <h3>Role Model</h3>
            I hope to be a strong role model for incoming students within the IT Data Analytics program this fall. <br>
            Speaking with incoming students in September, and helping them navigate their course schedule would be <br>
            something I would take pride in. <br>
